# ✍️ JotNet



Today you'll be building out a minimal blogging platform called **✍️ JotNet**.

In its most complete form, the app should allow you to view a list of published blog posts and see each one in detail, add and delete posts, toggle the draft-status, and count the number of views.

> ⏰ **There are _many_ more requirements listed here than you have time to complete.** That is by design. The goal is to complete as much as possible in the time allotted. 
> 
> You may skip requirements marked “(OPTIONAL)”; while completing them can increase your grade, they only offer a chance to demonstrate skills not otherwise required for the app to function. Try not to skip any other requirements.

## System Requirements

- Local, running MySQL (v8) server
- Node (v16) and npm (v8)
- Google Chrome or a browser with equivalent dev tools
- VS Code or a similar Web IDE with default settings
  - You may use the _Prettier_ extension to format code when necessary

## Phase 0: Before Beginning...



- [ ] Navigate to the prompt directory and install the project’s dependencies.
- [ ] Create a copy of the `📄 example.env` file and call it `.env`, if such a file doesn't exist. The values in the new file will populate your environment variables, and database credentials in particular.
- [ ] Ensure that the MySQL server is running on your computer (e.g. with `mysql.server start` or `brew services start mysql`)
- [ ] Quickly scan the requirements below and study the provided codebase to assess what's been provided to you, what you will need to refactor, and what you might need to create to complete the app.
- [ ] When ready, in two separate terminals, run the `server-dev` and `client-dev` scripts.
  - Don't be alarmed if you are greeted with errors! We are going to fix things in Phase 1. 🧘
  - Remember to run all scripts from prompt directory  `JotNet/` (not the outer assessment directory or any sub-directories). Commands, environment variables or build steps may break if they are run from the wrong location. 

## Phase 1: The List

Let’s build the main view of the app: a list of posts.

### Part 1. Set up the server



📞 _Callbacks or_ 🤞 _Promises? You may use either pattern to complete any async requirements below._

- [ ] For the rest of the assessment, make sure to still add and commit work after each checkbox step, **_at minimum_**! Use descriptive commit messages.
- [ ] Create a database `jotnet` in MySQL. You may use the terminal to do this. 
- [ ] In `📄 server/db.js`, create a connection to the `jotnet` database, using the values in `📄 .env` 
- [ ] In that same file, complete the query to create a table of "posts", for if one doesn't exist. Each record should contain:

  - **ID** (a primary key integer)
  - **title** (a short string)
  - **content** (multiple paragraphs)
  - **summary** (a single paragraph)
  - **status** ("public" or "draft")
  - **image ID** (an Unsplash Image ID, about 12 characters long)
  - **views** (integer)
  - ... and **created_at** / **updated_at** fields (provided). See the `📄 examples/postsData.json` file for example data.

- [ ] Implement the `createOne` method in the Post model, in `📄 models/Post.js` (`deleteAll` is completed for you).
- [ ] Seed the database by running the `📄 seed.js` file.
  - [ ] Debug any errors by updating your model. Do NOT change the seed script.
  - [ ] (OPTIONAL) Also consider adding an NPM script that will run the `seed` file.
- [ ] Implement the `findAll` method in the Post model by writing an SQL query.
  - Note that the results should be in _reverse-chronological order (newest first)._
  - Make sure to handle errors in this and other async methods.
- [ ] Implement the `getPosts` request-handler in `📄 controllers/posts.js`.
- [ ] Set up a route in `📄 server/index.js` by which clients can retrieve all the posts saved in the database.
- [ ] Add the ability for the server to serve up static assets from the `📂 client/dist` directory - this is where Webpack is already configured to put generated client files.
- [ ] (OPTIONAL) In `📄 server/middleware/logger.js` write a custom middleware function which will log the type and path (and query parameters) of the incoming request.
  - [ ] Mount this middleware function so that it runs for _all_ incoming requests.

> At this point in the project you should have a populated database and a running server.

### Part 2. Implement the client



- [ ] Read the commentary in `📄 client/src/components/App.jsx`; this file will need to be _minimally_ edited in later steps.
- [ ] In `📄 client/src/components/List.jsx`, initialize some state to hold an array of “posts”.
- [ ] When the component is mounted, retrieve the posts from your server with an AJAX request.
- [ ] Render each post in the retrieved list as a Card component:
  - Example markup of the List and Card components can be found in the `📂 example` folder. The rendered DOM should be _as close to the provided markup as possible_ – the provided CSS only works for specific tags and nesting.
  - [ ] Implement a Card component using props passed to it from the List component in `📄 client/src/components/Card.jsx`.
    - Note: the Card component should only render a post’s summary, not its full text.
    - Only show the `<sup>Draft</sup>` tag if the post’s status is “draft”.
  - [ ] (OPTIONAL) The Card component should display when its post was created in a human-friendly format. Research how to format the creation date using the imported function, from the [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.28.0/docs/Getting-Started) library.
    - _You may skip formatting the date until it's required in Phase 3._
  - [ ] If there are no posts, the List component should _conditionally render_ a message alerting the user.

> You should now be able to navigate to the app in your browser and see a list of cards for each of the posts in your database.

## Phase 2: POSTing Posts



Let’s implement the ability to add new posts to our budding blogging platform!

- [ ] Implement the `addPost` function in the server-side controllers, using the `createOne` model method from earlier.
- [ ] Add a server route that handles a POST request
  - [ ] Ensure that you are able to read the request’s body data.
- [ ] In `📄 client/src/components/App.jsx`, un-comment the “New Post” navigation list-item. Refresh the page; you should see a new option on the page to navigate to the “New Post” form.
- [ ] In the Form component (`📄 client/src/components/Form.jsx`) convert the inert inputs into _controlled components_:
  - [ ] Each input should update its corresponding state when interacted with.
    - Warning: the draft-status checkbox will need to be handled differently than the text-inputs. When checked, the value should be “draft”. When unchecked – and by default – the value should be “public”. Look for the `checked` property on the input. You may skip this input and tackle it after the rest of your form is working.
  - [ ] Each input should reflect its corresponding state’s value
- [ ] When the form is submitted, send the data to the server to be saved.
  - [ ] Solve for any errors or unexpected behaviors.
  - You may need to provide a summary field when submitting the form. Feel free to use some placeholder string. We will tackle parsing out a summary in a future phase.
  - [ ] Note that the App component gives the form an `onSubmit` prop. Make sure this is called at the appropriate time, after the submission has been saved.

> You should now be able to navigate to the form and submit a post which gets saved in the database. Once the request is successfully completed, you should be navigated to the list view, where you should be able to see your new post in the list.

## Phase 3: Seeing Details



It’s all well and good to be able to retrieve and create posts but a blog is only good if you can actually read it. Let’s allow user to click on a post and see all its contents...

- [ ] Implement the `findByID` method in the Post model.
- [ ] Set up a route in `📄 server/index.js` (and corresponding controller `getPost`)by which clients can retrieve a single post based on the parameter. For example, a GET request for `/posts/2` to return the post with the ID “2”.
- In `📄 client/src/components/App.jsx`, note that the List is given a `showPostOnClick` prop. This will switch the view to the Detail component, which in turn will be given an `id` prop.
- [ ] In `📄 client/src/components/List.jsx`, pass an `onClick` prop to each Card. This function should call `showPostOnClick` and pass the ID of the Card’s post as an argument.
  - Due to the way the App component has been implemented, `showPostOnClick` accepts an ID in the format `{id: post.id}`.
- [ ] Inside the Card component, make sure the `onClick` prop is invoked whenever the `<aside/>` is clicked.
- [ ] Complete the Detail component based on the HTML markup in `📄 example/Detail.html`
  - [ ] When it is mounted, it should make a request to the API for the individual post, based on the `id` prop
  - [ ] Like a Card, the Detail view should render the creation time in a human-friendly format.
  - [ ] _Unlike_ a Card, the Detail view must render the content of a post instead of just the summary. Make sure each paragraph of the content is rendered in a discrete paragraph element.

> At this point in the project you should be able to click on a post in the list and see a full view of the post.

## Phase 4: Algorithmic Interlude



In the previous phases we skipped over creating true summaries for the posts. Let’s fix that by creating a helper function which will accept the content of our posts and extract a summary from that text:

- [ ] A stub of this function can be found in `📄 client/src/lib/parseContent.js`. Make sure it is correctly exported from that file and imported into the Form component, where it will be invoked.
- [ ] In the Form component, replace the `content` and `summary` fields of the outgoing request body with the properties returned by the helper function.
- [ ] Back in the `parseContent` function, complete its implementation to meet the following criteria:
  - [ ] It should return an object containing `content` and `summary` fields.
  - [ ] The summary field should be taken from the start of the content, whatever it is.
  - [ ] The summary should have an ellipses, “...”, at the end of the string.
  - [ ] The summary should be no greater than 256 characters long.
  - [ ] The content should be edited so that there are exactly two newline characters, `\n`, between each paragraph. (This will help reliably format the paragraphs in the Detail view; see the contents in `📄 examples/postsData.json` for guidance).
  - [ ] (OPTIONAL) Instead of just using the first 256 characters, allow authors of posts to mark where they want their summaries to end with `<!-- summary -->` in their text.
    - For example, the input `"This is the summary<!-- summary --> and this is the rest of the content"` should produce a result object: `{content: "This is the summary and this is the rest of the content", summary: "This is the summary"}`
  - [ ] Add one new test to the `📄 client/src/lib/parseContent.test.js` suite to ensure your function is working as expected.
    - [ ] Install the Jest npm module, which we can use to run our tests. Once Jest is installed, the test file can be run with the command `npx jest`

> Once you are done with the algorithm, any new posts will be saved with auto-extracted summaries.

## Phase 5: Head to Headers



We’re going to practice with sending and receiving headers to augment our requests with metadata. But first let’s build some routes and components to practice with:

- [ ] Within the post model, complete the `deleteByID` method.
- [ ] Within your server-side controllers, complete the `deletePost` request-handler (with an `id` url-parameter, so you know which post to delete!).
- [ ] Un-comment the code in `📄 client/src/components/App.jsx` that will allow the user to navigate to the Admin Panel
- In the `📄 client/src/components/Admin.jsx` component:
  - [ ] Set up state to hold onto a list of all the posts (just like in the List component).
  - [ ] Download all the posts when the component mounts (just like in the List component).
  - [ ] Render the list of posts as a table (~~just like in the List component~~ check the Admin HTML file for what the component should render).
  - [ ] Write a `deletePost` method which will send a DELETE request for a single post
    - [ ] Add a listener which will invoke it every time any post’s red “X” icon (❌) is clicked.
  - Don’t worry about the views or toggling the draft status for now.

> At this point we should be able to click on the Admin button in the navigation and see a table-list of all the posts. Once there, we should be able to delete a post.

Now that we have a route in place, let’s make it a little harder to delete a post... Our server should require every delete request to contain a particular header. If there is no header or the secret passcode does not match, the request should result in an error.

- [ ] In the Admin component, make sure the outgoing DELETE request contains a header with the key “Auth” and a value that matches the AUTH_SECRET set in `📄 .env`.
  - Due to some Webpack-enabled magic, you may refer to `process.env.AUTH_SECRET` in your client-side code. 🤯
- [ ] In `📄 server/middleware/authChecker.js` write a middleware function:
  - [ ] That checks the headers of the incoming request for an “Auth” header and compares it to the secret.
  - If the codes match, allow the deletion to progress; if the codes don’t match, send a 401-Unauthorized response instead.
- [ ] Ensure the middleware function you just defined runs before the `deletePost` request-handler.

> Woohoo! We now have a mechanism by which we can allow or disallow certain actions to be taken on the server. We can upgrade this in the future to use user-identifying sessions as a basis for authorization but headers will need to be enough for now.

## Phase 6: Coding Coda



This last section will round out the functionality of the Admin view and put finishing touches on the app. The requirements are a little more vague; tip: plan / pseudo-code your approach before jumping into code.

- [ ] Complete any other incomplete or skipped requirements, marked as “(OPTIONAL)” above.
- [ ] Allow the user to toggle the draft status of a post in the admin view’s checkboxes.
- [ ] When a user navigates to the detail view of a post, send a PUT or PATCH request to the server to increment the number of views for that post.
